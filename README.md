# San Francisco's Local Story Finder

**[Visit the Live Site](https://localstoryfinder.github.io)**

## Overview
The Local Story Finder is a tool designed to help readers discover local stories in the San Francisco Bay Area. By aggregating content from multiple local news sources via NewsAPI and RSS feeds, the platform provides a searchable database of articles that can be filtered by author, publication, or topic.

## Background
People trust local news more than any other kindâ€”and for good reason. Local journalism keeps communities informed, connected, and engaged. In fact, 85% of Americans say local news is at least somewhat important to their community, with nearly half calling it extremely or very important. San Francisco is home to a thriving local news scene, powered by curious, dedicated journalists. We built a tool to make it easier to find them.

By centralizing access to content from local news outlets, this project aims to:
1. Make local journalism more discoverable
2. Highlight the work of smaller news outlets
3. Promote awareness of local news sources

## Features
- **Automatic Content Aggregation**: Daily updates from both NewsAPI and RSS feeds
- **Author Pages**: Dedicated pages for each journalist with their collected works 
- **Search Functionality**: Find articles by author, publication, or topic
- **Responsive Design**: Works on mobile and desktop devices

## Technical Implementation

### Data Collection
- **NewsAPI Integration**: Fetches articles from local SF news outlets

### Frontend
