            <p>People trust local news more than any other kind—and for good reason. Local journalism keeps communities informed, connected, and engaged. In fact, 85% of Americans say local news is at least somewhat important to their community, with nearly half calling it extremely or very important.</p>
            <p>San Francisco is home to a thriving local news scene, powered by curious, dedicated journalists. We built a tool to make it easier to find them.</p>
            <p>The Local Journalist Finder helps you discover the people behind the bylines. Search by name, outlet, or topic to connect with the journalists covering what matters in your community.</p>
