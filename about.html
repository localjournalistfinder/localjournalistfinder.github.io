            <p>People trust local news more than any other kind—and for good reason. Local journalism keeps communities informed, connected, and engaged. In fact, 85% of Americans say local news is at least somewhat important to their community, with nearly half calling it extremely or very important.</p>
            <p>San Francisco is home to a thriving local news scene, powered by curious, dedicated journalists. We built a tool to make it easier to find them.</p>
            <p>The Local Story Finder helps you discover the stories that matter to you and the people behind the bylines. Search by name, outlet, or topic to connect with the stories covering what matters in your community.</p>
